But later that evening, his children discovered the delicious nectar and robbed the cooler, drinking 4 of those gallons of root beer.  On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.  On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.  If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?\\nAnswer:\"\n",

Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable.

Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks.
